# Intro
Syncer allows a user to securely sync files and folders using standard
commercial file syncing software, a la [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/),
[OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/), etc. Files sent in the syncing software's
folder are encrypted, which means that Dropbox never sees the contents (or names or directory structure) of your files.

Alternatively, you can retrieve the source code via:
